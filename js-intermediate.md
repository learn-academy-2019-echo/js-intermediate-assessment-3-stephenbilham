  Your answer: Class and hold multiple objects inside. 

  Researched answer:
  
  The difference is simple and conceptual. A class is a template for objects.
  A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value.
  A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class.
  An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly 
  define or that are defined by default settings.
